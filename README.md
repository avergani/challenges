# challenges deploy

To deploy the Spring Boot project, follow these specific steps:

1- Build the project: Make sure you have JDK 17 and Maven installed. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your Spring Boot project. Build the project by running "mvn clean compile". This will compile the source code, run tests, and package the project into an executable format.

2- Package the application: After the build is successful, you will find the packaged application artifact in the target directory. In this case a WAR file. This artifact contains all the necessary dependencies and can be run in a production environment.

3- Set up the production environment: Prepare the environment where you want to deploy the application. Ensure that the production environment has Java (JRE) installed.

4- Configure the application: Review the configuration files in the project, such as application.properties, and set the appropriate values for the production environment. This includes database connection settings, logging configurations.

5- Start the application: On the production environment, navigate to the directory where you transferred the packaged artifact. Use the command to start the Spring Boot application. For a JAR file, you can use the command java -jar <filename.jar>. Make sure to replace <filename.jar> with the actual name of your JAR file.

6- Monitor the logs: Check the application logs to ensure that the application starts successfully and there are no errors. You can find the logs in a file named <application>.log

7- Configure the server: If you're deploying the application into a server like Apache Tomcat, move the WAR file to the webapps folder, or follow the specific server's documentation to configure it to run the Spring Boot application. Finally run the app server.

9- Test the deployed application: Access the application using its designated URL or IP address and perform thorough testing to ensure that it functions correctly in the production environment. Test the endpoint and functionalities to verify that the deployed solution behaves as expected.

By following these detailed steps, you should be able to deploy the projects into a production environment.
